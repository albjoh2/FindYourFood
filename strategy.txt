Connect your frontend and backend: Use axios or another 
library to make HTTP requests from your React app to your 
Express.js server.

Implement the features of your app: Use React components to 
build the user interface of your app. Use Express.js to handle 
backend functionality, such as storing data in the database.

Test your app: Use testing frameworks like Jest and Enzyme 
to test your app and ensure it works as expected.

Deploy your app: Use a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS to 
deploy your app to the internet.
